## Finding Differences
This is my second project as part of my studies on the Hexlet platform.
This project was built using these tools:

| Tool | Description |
| :------:| :-----------:|
| [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) | "An extremely fast Python package and project manager, written in Rust" |
| [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) | "An extremely fast Python linter and code formatter, written in Rust" |
| [json](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) | "Built-in module that allows you to encode (serialize) and decode (deserialize) data in JSON format" |
| [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) | "Part of the standard library and provides a way to parse command-line arguments and options"
